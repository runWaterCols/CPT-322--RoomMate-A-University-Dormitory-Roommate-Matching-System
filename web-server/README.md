# Steps to run the web server
  - Install a docker engine (probably docker desktop)
  - Clone this repository
  - Navigate to `/web-server/` in a terminal
  - Run `docker compose up --build`

# When writing code
Rerun the docker command that way it copies the files over again, it will run quicker since you have already compiled the rest of the server.
